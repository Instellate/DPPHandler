# DPPHandler

An "advanced" handler (internally) that registers commands for you!

You ever wished "Man, I can't be arsed modifying my main.cpp file just to add a command.".  
Well. I got a solution. This command handler does that for you and some other utility stuff as well!

## WIP

This is still a work in progress. I do want to add database support and other stuff as well. So that's going to be
implemented later as well.
